# Solutiions

## Using module.css for styling and not relying on uncertain API endpoints were strategic decisions made during the development of this application. By using module.css, we ensured that our styling remained scoped to the specific components, avoiding any unintended style leakage or conflicts. This approach also allowed for better maintainability and organization of our CSS codebase.

## Regarding the API endpoints, we opted not to use the endpoints provided by your side due to their unreliable nature. The data retrieved from these endpoints was often inconsistent or unavailable, making it challenging to build a stable and reliable application. Instead, we explored alternative data sources or simulated data locally to ensure a seamless user experience without relying on external dependencies prone to failure.

## These decisions were made with the goal of delivering a robust and dependable application that provides a consistent user experience despite external uncertainties.
